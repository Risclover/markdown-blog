As an unemployed software engineer, my days are far from ordinary. Contrary to popular belief, being unemployed doesn't mean I'm lounging around waiting for opportunities to come knocking on my door. Instead, I embark on a relentless journey to stay competitive in an industry that demands continuous growth and adaptation. In this blog post, I'll take you through a typical day in my life, shedding light on the challenges I face and the steps I take to overcome them, all while striving to navigate a job market that often sets daunting requirements for entry-level positions.

# Daily Schedule

<strong><u>8:30am - 9:00am: Morning Routine</u></strong>
Each morning, I rise with determination, ready to tackle the day ahead. To kickstart my routine, I engage in activities that fuel my mind and spirit. I dedicate time to browsing through emails, checking social media accounts, and staying updated with the latest industry news. This morning warm-up not only helps me stay connected but also fuels my motivation to excel in a field that is as challenging as it is rewarding. Sometimes, I'll finish off this half-hour period with a round of Fortnite, which is my favorite way to start the day off on a fun and positive note.

<strong><u>9:00am - 10:00am: Job Searching Activities, Pt. 1</u></strong>
Immediately following my morning warm-up is an hour of job searching activities. This includes researching companies to potentially apply for, writing cover letters, completing applications, networking, and outreach. Sometimes, I'll spend the entire hour just filling out applications, as I believe someone is bound to recognize my potential; I just have to find the right opportunity.

<strong><u>10:00am - 12:00pm: Data Structures & Algorithms Studies/Practice</u></strong>
The next two hours are allocated to studying and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms – typically one hour for studies and one hour for practice. I utilize various resources like textbooks, online platforms, and coding challenges such as Leetcode and HackerRank. This helps me take notes, clarify any confusion, and solve problems that might appear in technical interviews. Not only does this preparation sharpen my skills, but it also allows me to grow as an engineer. Given my love for learning, spending hours on this never exhausts me.

<strong><u>12:00pm - 2:00pm: Language/Technology Studies/Practice</u></strong>
After a short break, I dedicate an hour to studying a specific programming language or technology. Currently, I'm focused on learning TypeScript, particularly its application with React. As with Data Structures and Algorithms, I spend an hour studying and taking notes, followed by an hour of hands-on practice. There's no better way to learn a new language or technology than by actively using it.

<strong><u>2:00pm - 3:00pm: Lunch break</u></strong>
After completing my language/technology studies, I take an hour for myself to have lunch and indulge in some video games. Despite my passion for software engineering and love for learning, even I need a mental break amidst the day's activities.

<strong><u>3:00pm - 5:00pm: Project Work</u></strong>
Following lunch, my favorite time of the day arrives – project work. I spend around two hours either enhancing existing projects or starting new ones. My Reddit clone, Ribbit, is an ongoing project that always captures my interest, but I also explore other exciting ideas that come to mind.

<strong><u>5:00pm - 6:00pm: Job Searching Activities, Pt. 2</u></strong>
After a final 15-minute break, I allocate another hour to job searching activities. I find it more efficient to split the time into two sessions rather than doing it consecutively. This way, I can accomplish more without feeling overwhelmed.

<strong><u>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Evening Cooldown</u></strong>
Finally, I end my day just as I started it, with what I call the "evening cooldown." I check my email and job board accounts once more, ensuring I haven't missed any important updates. Additionally, I stay updated with any new developments in the software engineering realm. Recently, I've made it a point to officially "clock off" during this time to prioritize my family, friends, and other hobbies. As much as I enjoy software engineering, maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial.

# Conclusion

As an unemployed software engineer, my days are packed with activities aimed at growth and staying competitive. From morning warm-ups to job searching, studying data structures and algorithms, learning new languages and technologies, indulging in project work, and finally, winding down in the evening, I strive to make the most of my circumstances. While unemployment poses challenges, I remain determined to forge ahead, knowing that my efforts will eventually lead to fulfilling opportunities in this dynamic industry.
